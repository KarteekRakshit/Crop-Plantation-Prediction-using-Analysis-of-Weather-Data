# Crop-Plantation-Prediction-using-Analysis-of-Weather-Data
In this project we are analyzing weather data and using the obtained result in predicting what kind of crops that can be grown under various weather conditions in all the districts in Tamilnadu using Hadoop ecosystems like HDFS, map reduce for analyzing and Fuzzy reasoning for prediction. 

You can go through the Published paper at https://www.irjet.net/archives/V4/i4/IRJET-V4I4761.pdf

"Map Reduce Code.txt" contains all the codes for crating a map reduce framework to process the data o cloudera which we had set up using a virtual machine.
"ClimateData.csv" contains the weather data
"Output1.png" shows the output from the map reduce program.
